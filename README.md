# Sound Player

A responsive and interactive web-based sound player that allows users to play, pause, and navigate through a list of Quranic surahs. Each surah is accompanied by an image and the name of the reciter. Built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

3. Open `index.html` in your browser.

## How It Works

- The player displays one surah at a time with its title, reciter name, and image.
- JavaScript handles loading the correct audio and image, managing the play state, updating the progress bar, and switching between surahs.
- Clicking on the progress bar will seek to that position in the audio.
- The player auto-plays the next surah when the current one ends.
